                    Having been discovered by Stephen Hawking during his research on black holes in 1974, Moody was a
                    big part of proving Hawking’s theory that black holes aren’t completely black. As the only living
                    organism in the hole, he spends his time floating and bouncing around to pass the time.

                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                As a part of proving Hawking’s theory that black holes aren’t completely black, his theory postulates
                that ​​black holes can indeed emit light, or more specifically, radiation. This radiation, in turn,
                gradually drains energy in the form of light particles that spring up around black holes' potent
                gravitational fields. This creature was born on August 6, 1945, following the atomic bombings of
                Hiroshima
                and Nagasaki. Because of how black holes work, it is technically a 1-year-old because 80 Earth years is
                1 year in a black hole. Created by the mushroom-shaped cloud-developed light organisms that transported
                at the speed of light and entered into a black hole, Moses Moody is named after the Warriors rookie NBA
                player because of the various emotions and moods he shows. Living amid various cosmic particles, Moody
                wastes away his days by roaming the hole trying to look for a new friend.

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                You can interact with this creature by controlling what each face is feeling and the amount of heads the
                creature will have.If you move the mouse up and down, the creature will change its mood. If you hold
                onto the mouse, the creature will get dizzy and rotate around. You can also tickle him by clicking the
                mouse rapidly and he will do a little shimmy dance.
